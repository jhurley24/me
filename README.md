ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m John.

I'm an Associate Designer at Cantina. I combine a graphic design background with technology and user-centered design thinking to collaboratively solve complex problems and champion positive outcomes for users.

While at Cantina, I've been fortunate enough to work with some incredibly talented individuals on innovative applications and services for emerging technologies, health care, privacy and security, music, and insurance. I recently lead a team that was recognized in an OpenIDEO competition on reimagining visual metaphors for cybersecurity. Last summer, I also helped launch an exhibit in the Prudential Center to start a dialogue with the public about innovation in-home health care services.

I regularly write about visual design topicsâ€”most recentlyâ€”animation and icon design, and teach visual design principles at Cantina. I also recently gave a webinar talk with Lead Designer Alice Chiang on best practices for prototyping. Currently, I'm not looking for new opportunities, but I am open to innovative side projects. Please don't hesitate to reach out.
